## Favorit CPSC 120 Lab

* LAB 9:
  The interesting exercise, Lab 9 Part-1, Judge.cc, solves practical figure skating scoring problems by combining programming and mathematical computation. Its complexity adds richness and excitement to the educational process. On the side, I had fun with my partner working on that lab. We encountered some struggles, but eventually, we were able to figure it out.

* LAB 4:
  I liked Lab 4 Part-2; I found it interesting because the Hi-Lo game idea makes it more engaging for programmers as well as players by incorporating randomness and decision-making. Developing the program to manage various situations, like accurate guesses, incorrect guesses, and finally losing, tests the developers' ability to use conditional statements and reason logically.

* LAB 10:
  Lab 10 Part-2 was challenging to put together. The lab replicates a situation where managing and organizing data is necessary in the real world. Here, the data pertains to county populations in California. Programming tasks frequently involve managing such data in an organized and effective manner, providing invaluable experience.
